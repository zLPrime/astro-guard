Data reader:

+ extract keys
+ cache keys
+ sample
+ read content
+ extract features
+ create bitmaps
+ encapsulate module functions
+ eliminate memory leakage
+ introduce data cache
+ change data representation (1-dimentional)
- shuffle objects
- augment data
-- sample
++ pick a channel
- add more nonvarables
+ add magn_err
+ try other sizes

Training:

+ accept optimizer and other
+ early stop
+ save best model & trainer state
- make testing score adjustable
-- let it accept multiple scores and pick one as stop criterion (can be plotted afterwards)

Testing:

- think about different benchmarks (acc, f1, ...)

Model:

- dropout
